This is an ongoing project, a commandline calculator that does arithmetic on an 
infinite amount of digits. This is achieved through char pointers and parsing
algorithms of each char for processing involving arithmetic, carry, and borrow.
A stack of chars is used in assistance of these functions to produce correct
output character by character. The arithmetic functions are found in 
OperationsLib.c in addition to other calculations. HelperLib.c does house
keeping while performing arithmetic. Amount of digits capable by this 
calculator is defined in a macros file along with a constant that allows 
conversion between integer to character. The intent of this project is to
parse cammondline arguments where an operator calls a function and performs
the intended operation on the operands. This calculator is also able to
find greatest common factor and list a sequence of perfect numbers given an
upperbound limit.
